# Complete Email Setup Testing Guide

## What I've Built

✅ **Simple Email Solution**: Works like WordPress - just add your email credentials
✅ **Admin Dashboard Integration**: Each form's recipient emails configured through admin panel  
✅ **All Forms Covered**: Contact, Discovery Call, Talk Growth - all send emails automatically
✅ **Fallback System**: SMTP first, SendGrid as backup if needed

## How It Works

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Go to Forms section, set recipient emails for each form
2. **SMTP Setup**: Add your email credentials (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook supported)
3. **Automatic Emails**: All form submissions automatically sent to configured emails

## Form Mapping

| Website Form | Admin Config Name | Email Goes To |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Contact Page - Send Message | `contact_send_message` | Recipients you set |
| About Page - Let's Talk | `about_lets_talk` | Recipients you set |
| Services - Get Started | `services_get_started` | Recipients you set |
| Services - Custom Plan | `services_custom_plan` | Recipients you set |
| Discovery Call (all pages) | `discovery_call` | Recipients you set |
| Home - Work With Us | `home_work_with_us` | Recipients you set |

## Email Content

Each email includes:
- Form type and submission details
- All field data formatted nicely
- Timestamp
- Professional HTML formatting with your brand colors
