DESIGN BRIEF
Overall Style:
Clean, modern layout with soft scroll animations
Subtle animated background (gradient shift, floating icons, or abstract visuals)
Use your brand colors from the logo (deep blue, light gray, electric green accents)
Friendly but premium tone
Layout should feel like a conversation — not a stiff corporate form
📌 HEADER (Sticky Topbar)
Logo + Navigation: Home | Services | About | Contact (active)
Transparent background on load, turns solid white on scroll
💬 Section 1: “Let’s Get in Touch”
Design:
Left side: friendly image or animated illustration (e.g., someone replying to messages, laptop + coffee vibes)
Right side: intro text and the form
Copy:
